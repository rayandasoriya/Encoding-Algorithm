# encryption_cpp
 
 This program provides an encryption method which is quite efficient as it selects random number and not easy to crack.

It checks if the entered number is a four-digit number and if it is, then it squares the number and multiply it with a random number between 5 and 30 and then add a number between 5 and 1005(this is how encryption takes place) and then decrypts it, otherwise it is rejected.
